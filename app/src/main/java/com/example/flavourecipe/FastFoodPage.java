                "1.\tStart the recipe the day before you want to eat the pizza. In the morning, to make sure your starter is lively, discard 50g in weight (or save to make a sourdough loaf – see deliciousmagazine.co.uk for a recipe), then feed with 25g white bread flour and 25g water. Put a plastic band round the container, then leave at room temperature, lid slightly ajar, until the starter is bubbling and has increased in volume (4-6 hours).\n" +
                        "\n2.\tIn a measuring jug, weigh 50g lively sourdough starter and 260g water, mix until combined, then stir in the 1 tbsp olive oil. In a separate mixing bowl, combine both flours with the salt. Pour the starter mixture into the flour, then mix with a dough scraper, spatula or a wet hand to bring together into a shaggy dough. Cover with a clean tea towel, then leave to rest for 30 minutes.\n" +
                        "\n3.\tWith floured hands, turning the bowl as you go, stretch and fold the dough over itself, pressing into the middle, until it starts to feel more resistant and firm. Put in an oiled bowl, cover with a plastic bag and leave to rest at room temperature overnight (16-18 hours). The room needs to be quite warm, so if your kitchen is cold it might be best to put the bowl in an airing cupboard.\n" +
                        "\n4.\tThe next morning, divide the dough into 4 (or 2 large) equal pieces, then shape each into a ball. To do this, first stretch the dough and fold it over itself to form a round shape, then turn the dough ball over and, with cupped hands, pull the dough towards you, turning a few times to create a taught surface. Transfer the dough to a floured baking dish or put in separate lidded containers covered with a plastic bag/cling film, then leave to prove for 2-4 hours at room temperature. If you’re not eating until the evening (or the next day or later) put in the fridge to slow-prove – see tips, previous page.\n" +
                        "\n5.\tTo make the sauce, put all the ingredients (except the basil) in a pan with a generous pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes on a low-medium heat, breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon every so often until reduced and thickened. Set aside to cool, then whizz with a stick blender until smooth. Set aside to cool.\n" +
                        "\n6.\t15 minutes before baking, heat/light your pizza oven or heat your grill to hot and have your cast iron/ovenproof frying pan to hand.\n" +
                        "\n7.\tOn a floured work surface, using floured hands, gently pull and stretch out a doughball to form a circle roughly 22-24cm in diameter for a regular pizza or 32-34cm for a large pizza. Don’t let the dough tear\n",R.drawable.f1));
